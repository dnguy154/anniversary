            <h2>I love you so muchhh you ain't even KNOW boii, it's the second anniversary already.... <br> How time has past so fast..., 
            thank you for everything you've done for me these past 2 years, <br>
            you've brought nothing but joy and laughter to my life and I can't be thankful enough. <br>
            (also besides emptying my wallet but it's worth it for my bubbas :3) 
        <br> I hope you feel the same towards me, and I hope we can continue giving <br>
    and giving until the day we part (never). <br>
    I'm excited for our future wherever the roads leads us, i'm sure as long as i'm with you, i'll be okay <br>
(all roads lead to me.)</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Enjoy this gift i'm giving you, it's a reminder of your addiction to your beloved cursed game. <br>
    This is unfortunately not all of it, a special surprise will be announced to my pookie bear later this weekend.
<br> I don't want to hear any complaining because you deserve it my stink. <br> <br> Love, your bubba x</h2>
